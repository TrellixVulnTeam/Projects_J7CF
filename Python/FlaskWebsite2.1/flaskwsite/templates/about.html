            My name is Rados≈Çaw and I'm a 3rd year student of Electronics and Telecommunications
            at AGH - University of Science
            and Technology in Cracow. I have to say, I'm not a very electronics type of guy.
            I do much prefer telecommunications, more precisely networking and programming.
            In fact from last few months I've became very passionate about <mark>Python</mark> programming language.
            My goal is to focus on that great language and become an expert in it.
